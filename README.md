# Rotated object detection

This code uses Mask-RCNN (https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) as a base.

RBoxNet (rotated-bounding-box network) is a CNN to detect rotated bounding box. Its 
first goal is to detect objects in forward-looking sonar images. 

We have tested 3 different approaches for detections of rotated bounding-box, as follows:

* Vertices
* Box offsets
* Orientation and Size
